On trials higher in negative affect than average, participants higher in social
anxiety symptoms exhibited greater mentalizing network connectivity during the
friend run if they had higher connectivity during the self run. Conversely,
participants lower in social anxiety symptoms exhibited lower mentalizing
connectivity during the friend run if they had higher connectivity during the

## Plot
The effect is potentially driven by the friend's negative affect expressions. 
Low anxiety individuals had lower mentalizing network connectivity during 
friend run on trials with higher than average negative affect and higher than 
average connectivity during self run. That is if their connectivity was high 
while watching their friend express negative affect, their connectivity was low
when watching themselves

High anxiety individuals had higher mentalizing connectivity during the friend
run on trials with higher than average negative affect and higher than average 
connectivity during self run. That is if their connectivity was high while 
watching their friend express negative affect, their connectivity was also high
while watching themselves.
